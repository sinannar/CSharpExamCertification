Code in C# is contained in assemblies. 
Inside Visual Studio, you can think of an assembly as a project. 
This is where another access modifier can be used: internal. 
Internal restricts access to a type or a type member to the same assembly. 
It is more restrictive than public, but less than private. 
Internal is useful when you have a type, such as a helper class or an implementation
detail, that shouldn't be accessible outside of the assembly you’re building
