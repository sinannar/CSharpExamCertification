When you want to expose internal types or type members to another assembly, 
you can use a special attribute: 
InternalsVisibleToAttribute

You can use this attribute to specify another assembly that can also access the internal types. 
One situation where this can be useful is when you write unit tests. 
Maybe you have an internal class that encapsulates a difficult algorithm
and you want to write unit tests for it. 
Normally, you include this attribute inside the AssemblyInfo.cs file that’s stored in the Properties folder of your project:
[assembly:InternalsVisibleTo(“Friend1a”)]
[assembly:InternalsVisibleTo(“Friend1b”)]

You can use as many attributes as you need. 
In this example, the assemblies Friend1a and Friend1b are now allowed to access the internal types 
and members of your assembly
