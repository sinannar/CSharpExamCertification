Inheritance is a powerful technique, but it should be used with caution. 
As already mentioned, inheritance should be used only 
when you are dealing with a “is-a-kind-of” relationship.
The Liskov substitution principle states that 
a subclass should be usable in each place you can use one of the base classes. 
They shouldn’t suddenly change behavior that users would
depend on.
