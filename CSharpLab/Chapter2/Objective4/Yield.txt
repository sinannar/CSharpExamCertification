Notice the yield return in the GetEnumerator function. 
Yield is a special keyword that can be used only in the context of iterators. 
It instructs the compiler to convert this regular code to a state machine. 
The generated code keeps track of where 
you are in the collection and it implements methods such as MoveNext and Current.

Because creating iterators is so easy now, 
it has suddenly become a feature that you can use in your own code quite easily. 
Whenever you do a lot of manual loops through the same data structure, 
think about the iterator pattern and how it can help you create way nicer code.
