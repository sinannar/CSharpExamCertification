Before .NET existed, 
the first generation of the Windows API was based on a library of functions contained in a dynamic-link library (DLL). 
Later generations collected these functions into a Component Object Model (COM) interface. 
The .NET Framework provides classes that wrap much of these APIs in a managed version 
 so that in normal life you almost never touch any COM components directly.

Normally, you just add a reference to a COM object
 and the compiler generates the necessary wrapper classes called COM Interop classes. 
If this fails for some reason, 
you have to create the wrapper class; this is where the IUnknown interface is used.
