Another useful interface in the .NET Framework is IDisposable. 
This interface is used to facilitate working with external, unmanaged resources. 
As Objective 2.6 discusses, C# is a managed language that uses a garbage collector to clean up memory. 
However, you will still access external, 
unmanaged resources like database connections or file handles. 
This is where IDisposable comes into play.

The only method the IDisposable interface has is Dispose(). 
This method is used to free any unmanaged resources. 


public interface IDisposable
{
	void Dispose();
}
