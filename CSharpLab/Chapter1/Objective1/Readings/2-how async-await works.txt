in C# 5, two new keyword to simplfy asynchoronous code implementation which are async and await
Writing asynchnronous code is not easy, need to make sure all edge cases are handled.
With async, you mark your method has asynchronous operations and compiler knows something asynchronous is going to happen.
Comppiler transform code into state machine as response to this signal

A method marked with async just starts running synchoronously on the current thtread. Boundries marked with await keyboard split into multiple pieces.
When you use await keyword, the compiuler generate code that will see whether your asynchronous operation is already finished. 
If it is, your method continues to run synchronously, otherwise state machine will hook up continuation method that should run when the Task completes.
Method tields control to the calling thread and this thread can be used to do other work
